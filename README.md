# ENHANCING-STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-THROUGH-DATA-DRIVEN-GAP-ANALYSIS-AND-VISUALIZATION-USING-POWER-BI
In the era of data-driven education, timely identification of student learning gaps is crucial for academic success. This project leverages the powerful capabilities of Power BI to analyze and visualize comprehensive student performance data, enabling educators to make informed, real-time decisions. 
In the era of data-driven education, timely identification of student learning gaps is crucial for academic success. This project leverages the powerful capabilities of Power BI to analyze and visualize comprehensive student performance data, enabling educators to make informed, real-time decisions.
Through interactive dashboards, this solution provides insights into student attendance, assessment scores, subject-wise performance, engagement levels, and progression trends. By identifying underperforming areas, skill deficiencies, and at-risk students, it empowers institutions to implement targeted interventions. This not only enhances transparency and accountability but also fosters a personalized learning environment, ensuring no student is left behind.

The system uses Power BI Desktop for dashboard development. Data from Excel/CSV files is ingested via
Power Query, cleaned, and transformed. DAX is used for scoring logic:
Performance Score = (0.5 * Exam Score) + (0.2 * Internals) + (0.1 * Assignment) + (0.2 * Participation)
The dashboard features multiple visuals:
- KPI Cards for risk identification
- Line graphs for performance trends
- Filters for drill-down by student/class
Advanced users can integrate Python/R for prediction models.
